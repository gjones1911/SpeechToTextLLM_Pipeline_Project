Simple API Server for Testing
Provides a mock Gradio-style API for testing the voice chatbot integration

This is a test server that mimics Gradio API behavior for development purposes.
Run this server to test the API chatbot without needing actual Gradio setup.

Usage:
    python test_api_server.py
    
Then in another terminal:
    python api_chatbot.py --gradio-url "http://localhost:7860"
